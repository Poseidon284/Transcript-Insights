Audio/Video Transcription, Topic Recognition, and Summarization
Overview
This project processes audio and video files to generate transcripts, recognizes topics using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and provides summarization using a Large Language Model (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Key Features:
Audio/Video Input: Accepts multiple formats of audio and video files.
Transcription: Automatically converts speech from the input files into text using speech-to-text technology.
Topic Recognition: Identifies main topics from the transcript using the LDA model.
Summarization: Produces concise summaries of the transcripts using RAG, which improves accuracy by pulling relevant information from a database during the generation process.
Architecture
Input Stage: Audio/Video files are uploaded to the platform.
Transcription Stage: Files are processed by a speech-to-text engine (such as Google Cloud Speech API or Whisper).
Topic Recognition Stage: LDA model extracts major topics from the transcript.
Summarization Stage: LLM RAG model generates concise summaries, retrieving relevant data from a knowledge base as needed.
Output: The platform returns a fully transcribed, topic-recognized, and summarized output.
Workflow
Audio/Video Input → Speech-to-Text → Transcript
Transcript → Topic Recognition (LDA)
Transcript + Topics → Summarization (LLM RAG)
Files and Directories
transcribe.py: Handles the speech-to-text conversion.
topic_recognition.py: Performs topic modeling using LDA.
summarize.py: Summarizes the transcript using the RAG approach.
main.py: Orchestrates the full pipeline (transcription → topic recognition → summarization).
Dependencies
Speech-to-Text: google-cloud-speech or whisper
LDA Topic Modeling: gensim
Summarization (RAG): transformers, faiss-cpu, datasets, torch
Future Improvements
Implement real-time processing for streaming inputs.
Add multi-language support for transcription and summarization.
Improve topic modeling by incorporating other models like BERTopic.
Enable more granular control over the summarization (length, style, etc.).
